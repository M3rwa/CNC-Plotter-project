# CNC Plotter Project

The CNC Plotter project combines the power of C programming, Arduino, Processing, and Inkscape to create a versatile drawing machine capable of transforming your artistic visions into reality. Whether you're an artist, hobbyist, or just curious about exploring the intersection of technology and art, this project provides an exciting opportunity to unleash your creativity and create intricate and unique artwork with precision.

## Overview

The CNC Plotter is a DIY project that brings together various technologies to create a computer-controlled drawing machine. The project leverages the following components and software:

- C Programming: The project involves programming the Arduino microcontroller board using the C programming language. This allows you to define the desired behavior of the CNC Plotter and control its movements.

- Arduino: The Arduino board serves as the brain of the CNC Plotter. It receives commands from the computer and controls the motors and other hardware components to move the drawing mechanism accurately.

- Processing: The Processing programming language and development environment are used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) that interacts with the CNC Plotter. The GUI enables users to import images, convert them into a format suitable for plotting, and send commands to the Arduino.

- Inkscape: Inkscape, a powerful vector graphics editor, plays a vital role in the CNC Plotter project. It allows you to design and edit drawings or images that will be plotted by the machine. The SVG files created in Inkscape are converted into commands that the CNC Plotter understands.

## Features

- Precision Drawing: The CNC Plotter allows you to create intricate and precise drawings with smooth lines and curves.

- Versatility: With the ability to work with Inkscape, you can unleash your creativity and draw anything you desire.

- User-Friendly Interface: The Processing-based GUI provides an intuitive interface for importing, converting, and sending drawing commands to the CNC Plotter.

- Open-Source and Customizable: The project is open-source, allowing you to modify and customize the CNC Plotter to suit your specific requirements.

## Getting Started

To get started with the CNC Plotter project, follow these steps:

1. Set up the Hardware: Connect the Arduino board to the CNC Plotter's motors and other necessary components as per the provided instructions.

2. Install the Required Software: Install the Arduino IDE, Processing IDE, and Inkscape on your computer.

3. Upload the Arduino Sketch: Use the Arduino IDE to upload the provided sketch to the Arduino board.

4. Launch the Processing GUI: Open the Processing IDE and load the CNC Plotter GUI code. Run the code to launch the user interface.

5. Import and Convert Images: Use the GUI to import images into the project and convert them into a format suitable for plotting.

6. Send Commands to the CNC Plotter: Once the image is ready, use the GUI to send the commands to the Arduino, instructing the CNC Plotter to start drawing.

For detailed instructions, refer to the project documentation and user manual included in the repository.
